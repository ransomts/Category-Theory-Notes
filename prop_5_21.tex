\begin{Theorem}

  A category has all finite limits iff it has finite products and equalizers.

  \begin{Proof}
    Take a finite diagram
    $$ D : \textbb{J} \rightarrow C $$.

    Consider first the product
    $$ \prod_{i \in J_0} D_i $$
    which has correct projections $ p_j : \prod_{i \in J_0} D_i \rightarrow D_j  $
    \end{Proof}
  
\end{Theorem}

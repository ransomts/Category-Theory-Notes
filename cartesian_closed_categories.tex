\section{Cartesian Closed Categories}

Cartesian Closed Categories - Finite exponentials and finite products.

Exponential object - Functors from $\mathcal{A}$ to $\mathcal{B}$
$ \mathcal{B}^{\mathcal{A}} F : \mathcal{A} \rtarw \mathcal{B} $

In the category of posets, which are Transitive and anti-symmetric, the objects are just sets $X$ and the morphisms are defined as
%\[ \begin{cases} 
%      b, & $a \leq b$ \\
%      \emptyset, & $a \nleq b$
%   \end{cases}
% \]

 meaning that if there is a morphism between two objects, there is only one.

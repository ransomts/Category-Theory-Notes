\begin{definition}

  In any category C, an arrow $$ f : A \rtarw B $$ is
  called a \textit{monomorphism} if given any $ g, h : C \rtarw A$,
  $gh = fh$ implies $g = h$ \\

  \textit{epimorphism} if given any $i,j : B \rtarw D, if = jf$ implies $i = j$

  % TODO: put in diagrams and arrows with fancy heads/tails

\end{definition}

Having a left inverse is monic and having a right inverse is epic. Having both makes the mapping an isomorphism. In SETS, the converse of the previous is also true: every mono-epi is iso; but this is not true in the general case.
% TODO: Propostion 2.6

This definition of monomorphism is the category theory equivalent to injective and this definition of epimorphism is the surjective translation.


\begin{proposition}

  A \textit{function} $ f : A \rtarw B$ between sets is monic just in case it is injective. 
  
\end{proposition}
